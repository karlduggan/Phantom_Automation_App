# Phantom_Automation_App
Phantom List is a desktop Application for automating a sequence of instruction for mouse and keyboard using Python, PyAutoGui module and PyQt5 GUI framework. The initial idea was inspired by ghost mouse where a user can record mouse information and play it back. Having used PyAutoGui to automate tasks, I wanted to create a program using the PyAutoGui module and create a user interface with PyQt5 so that someone without knowledge of python would be able to use it. During the development I have tried to minimize the amount of button and windows to create a more simpler and minimalistic look.
